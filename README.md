# Code Questions Bot: Polling Feature
This repo contains a polling feature for https://github.com/VickiLanger/code-questions-bot. I'm not sure how to deploy this feature without using a separte repo, so here it is.

## Inspiration
@Roachbones created https://twitter.com/validpolls with https://github.com/Roachbones/is-it-valid. Tweepy doesn't support polls so @Roachbones wrote the script to open up firefox, create the poll, and tweet it.
